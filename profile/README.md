# Tools and Examples

Welcome! We're glad you're here. There's not much to see yet but stay tuned for some exciting additions in the near future!

## Mission

At Waveform Analytics, we believe that scientific progress happens best in an open and collaborative environment. The code you'll find here is openly available under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit). 

One of our core values is the belief that **promoting scientific and technical literacy is crucial in today's uncertain world**. 

There is an abundance of scientific data available, but it can be challenging to present those data in a way that's understandable.

At Waveform Analytics, we aim to develop  tools and expertise for translating complex findings into intuitive visuals.
