# Tools and Examples

Welcome! We're glad you're here. There's not much to see yet but stay tuned for some exciting additions in the near future!

## Mission

At Waveform Analytics, we believe that scientific progress happens best in an open and collaborative environment. The code you'll find here is freely available under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit). 

There is an abundance of scientific data available, but it can be challenging to present those data in a way that's understandable. We provide tools and expertise for translating complex findings into intuitive visuals.

For more information, or for inquiries about custom products or training, please email [info@waveformanalytics.com](mailto:info@waveformanalytics.com).
