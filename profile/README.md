## Tools and Examples

- **[Animal density demo](https://github.com/Waveform-Analytics/wa_density_demo)**: In this demo we walk through how you can load, prepare, and visualize marine mammal density data from [the Marine Geospatial Ecology Laboratory / Duke University](https://seamap.env.duke.edu/models/Duke/EC/). ([Live demo](https://waveform-analytics.github.io/wa_density_demo/)]
- **[Marine mammal exposures demo](https://github.com/Waveform-Analytics/wa_animat_demo)**: This dashboard explores a demo dataset describing the number of animals predicted to be impacted in some way from offshore construction noise. ([Live demo](https://waveform-analytics.github.io/wa_animat_demo/))
- **[Distances to noise impact thresholds](https://github.com/Waveform-Analytics/wf-distances)**: Installation of offshore wind turbines generates noise, and it's important, for monitoring and mitigation purposes, to understand how far away marine mammals need to be to avoid being injured or experiencing behavioral disturbance. This dashboard helps to quickly understand what the model results are showing. ([Live demo](https://waveform-analytics.github.io/wf-distances/))
- **[Acoustic indices and ocean biodiversity](https://github.com/Waveform-Analytics/osa-mbon)**: Waveform Analytics collaborated with [Ocean Science Analytics](https://www.oceanscienceanalytics.com/) to analyze acoustic data and build an interactive data dashboard. The dashboard helps scientists explore and better understand how certain acoustically derived indices might be linked to species presence and diversity.

## Mission

At Waveform Analytics, we believe that scientific progress happens best in an open and collaborative environment. The code you'll find here is freely available under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit). 

There is an abundance of scientific data available, but it can be challenging to present those data in a way that's understandable. We provide tools, examples, and expertise for translating complex findings into intuitive visuals.
