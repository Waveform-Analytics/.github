# Tools and Examples

Welcome! Our first repository is live! If you're curious, please head on over to the [animal density demo](https://github.com/Waveform-Analytics/wa_density_demo) and check out the **notebooks** folder for a quick overview of the processing steps.

## Mission

At Waveform Analytics, we believe that scientific progress happens best in an open and collaborative environment. The code you'll find here is freely available under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit). 

There is an abundance of scientific data available, but it can be challenging to present those data in a way that's understandable. We provide tools and expertise for translating complex findings into intuitive visuals.

For more information, or for inquiries about custom products or training, please email [info@waveformanalytics.com](mailto:info@waveformanalytics.com).

## Overview

### Animal density data exploration (Ongoing)

Link to Repository: [wa_density_demo](https://github.com/Waveform-Analytics/wa_density_demo)

In this repository we walk through how you can load, prepare, and visualize marine mammal density data from [the Marine Geospatial Ecology Laboratory / Duke University](https://seamap.env.duke.edu/models/Duke/EC/). You can follow along as we:

- organize the data into a format that is easier for us to work with
- systematically compute zonal statistics for regions of interest
- export summary statistics in a format that can be easily converted to a web-based visualization.
