## Mission

At Waveform Analytics, we believe that scientific progress happens best in an open and collaborative environment. The code you'll find here is openly available under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit). 

One of our core values is the belief that **promoting scientific and technical literacy is crucial in today's uncertain world**. 

Today, we have access to an unprecedented amount of scientific data. However, the communication of these findings to key groups — such as industry clients, government agencies, the public, and even fellow scientists — frequently poses significant challenges. At Waveform Analytics, we aim to develop the tools and expertise needed to translate complex findings into visual representations that can enable understanding and informed decision-making.
